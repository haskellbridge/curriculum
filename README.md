# Curriculum

## Explanation

A lot of finer points of Haskell are being intentionally skipped in the interest of showing people the "highlights" and having a gameplan that is tractable for a single workshop. Follow-up/future exercises & drill learners can do either on-site or on their own time belong in this repo as well, marked separately.

# Progression


## Arithmetic

- +, -, *, /, div


## Basic datatypes

- Bool

- Tuples

- String

- List
-- Show how Strings are [Char]


## Functions

- Show how to define, apply functions
-- Show how to load and use functions from a file in GHCi

- All functions take one argument, return one result
-- Show how you "chomp" through the (->)'s in a "multi" argument function

- Show to make functions unpack products (tuples)
-- pattern matching etc.

- Show to make functions vary their behavior by the inputs (sums)
-- if, case, pattern match


## Creating their own datatypes

- Products
-- Record syntax

- Sums

- Datatypes that take parameters
-- Avoid Identity here, they won't get the point.
-- Point to datatypes they've seen already, (a, b), [a], etc.


# Follow-up material

Stuff like NICTA course, but more isolated would be good here.


## Maybe

- Alej's Mabe should be linked here
